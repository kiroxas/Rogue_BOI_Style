This version just creates a random layout for a maze and displays it in a mini-map. Shows two characters on screen,
that you can move around with ugly animations.


## Installation

You'll need [SFML 2.0](http://www.sfml-dev.org/index-fr.php) 

And you need a compiler that supports C++11 features (Gcc 4.8 and newer, clang 3.3 and newer or visual 2010 and newer).

You can compile this project on your plateform, by cloning it, then run "cmake ." and then "make".*
You need to install SFML 2.0 on your own, but cmake should be able to detect its presence by itself (so no editing a configuration file for you).*
The program executable should be in <the root folder where you cloned>/bin/Kirogame
